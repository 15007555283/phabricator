@title User Guide: Phabricator Clusters
@group config

Guide on scaling Phabricator across multiple machines, for large installs.

Overview

IMPORTANT: Phabricator clustering is in its infancy and does not work at all
yet. This document is mostly a placeholder.

Locking Services
================

Very briefly, you can set "Can Manage Cluster Services" to "No One" to lock
the cluster definition.
